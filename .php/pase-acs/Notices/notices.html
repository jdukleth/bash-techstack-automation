KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any <br>
warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or <br>

the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks<br>
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether <br>
in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by <br>
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to<br>
in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including <br>
any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any <br>
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability<br>
to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other <br>
commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of<br>
the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>

or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, <br>
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations <br>
and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such <br>
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole <br>
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You <br>
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any <br>
liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by <br>
reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>

IBM Public License Version 1.0		<br>
	<br>
03 Mar 2005<br>
<br>
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES<br>
RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br>
<br>
1. DEFINITIONS<br>
<br>
"Contribution" means:<br>
1. in the case of International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), the Original Program, and<br>
2. in the case of each Contributor,<br>
   1. changes to the Program, and<br>
   2. additions to the Program;<br>
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are <br>
distributedby that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a <br>
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone<br>
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to <br>
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in <br>
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not<br>
derivative works of the Program.<br>
<br>
"Contributor" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.<br>
<br>
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are<br>
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when <br>
combined with the Program.<br>
<br>
"Original Program" means the original version of the software accompanying this<br>
Agreement as released by IBM, including source code, object code and documentation,<br>
if any.<br>
<br>
"Program" means the Original Program and Contributions.<br>
<br>
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, <br>
including all Contributors.<br>
<br>
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br>
<br>
1. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient <br>
a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce,<br>
prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and <br>
sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works,<br>
in source code and object code form.<br>
<br>
2. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient <br>
a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed<br>
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the <br>
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This<br>
patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program <br>
if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the<br>
Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. <br>
The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the<br>
Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<br>
<br>
3. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its <br>
Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that<br>
the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of <br>
any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims<br>
brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights <br>
or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted <br>
hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other<br>
intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent l<br>
icense is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's<br>
responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.<br>
<br>
4. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights <br>
in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.<br>
<br>
3. REQUIREMENTS<br>
<br>
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its <br>
own license agreement, provided that:<br>
1. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<br>
2. its license agreement:<br>
    1. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and <br>
       conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title <br>
       and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability<br>
       and fitness for a particular purpose;<br>
    2. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages,<br>
       including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, <br>
       such as lost profits;<br>
    3. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by <br>
       that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and<br>
    4. states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,<br>
       and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through <br>
       a medium customarily used for software exchange.<br>
<br>
When the Program is made available in source code form:<br>
1. it must be made available under this Agreement; and<br>
2. a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.<br>
<br>
Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:<br>
<br>
  Copyright© {date here}, International Business Machines Corporation and others.   <br>
  All Rights Reserved.<br>
<br>
In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its <br>
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients <br>
to identify the originator of the Contribution.<br>
<br>
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br>
<br>
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect<br>
to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to <br>
facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the <br>
Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not <br>
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor<br>
includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor "Commercial<br>
Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor <br>
("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively <br>
"Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third<br>
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or <br>
omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of <br>
the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do <br>
not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual <br>
property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: <br>
a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and <br>
b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the ommercial<br>
Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The <br>
Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.<br>
<br>
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering,<br>
Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that <br>
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related<br>
to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial <br>
Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor<br>
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those <br>
performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor <br>
to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.<br>
<br>
5. NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"<br>
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED <br>
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, <br>
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. <br>
Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of <br>
using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise<br>
of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of<br>
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs<br>
or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.<br>
<br>
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br>
<br>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY <br>
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,<br>
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), <br>
HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,<br>
OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR<br>
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN <br>
IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
7. GENERAL<br>
<br>
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, <br>
it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of <br>
this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision <br>
shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid <br>
and enforceable.<br>
<br>
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to <br>
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a <br>
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient <br>
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is<br>
filed. In addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program <br>
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) <br>
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under <br>
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply <br>
with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure <br>
such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such <br>
noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient<br>
agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably <br>
practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses<br>
granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.<br>
<br>
IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time <br>
to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version <br>
number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject <br>
to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after <br>
a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute<br>
 the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other<br>
than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in <br>
Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the <br>
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,<br>
by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly <br>
